# PythonRPGThing

This program is just a small simulation of an RPG battle in DOS.
You literally cannot die, it is not possible. Therefore there is no function
for player death. That is next, as I improve on this program later.

To run the program, launch the Run.bat file in this directory.
This program requires python2.7 to be run from the batch file (I don't think it will interpret
properly with Python3).
